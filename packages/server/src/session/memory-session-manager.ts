 * registry grows one row per session that ever ends, for the life of the
 * process. The snapshot WINDOW (`SNAPSHOT_ENDED_GLOBAL`) bounds what the
 * dashboard SHOWS, which is why the growth was invisible: the rows are bounded
 * in what they expose and unbounded in what they hold. Under churn
 * (many sessions coming and going) this is the dominant steady-state growth.
 *
 * The retention tier is therefore bounded at `MAX_RESIDENT_ENDED` NEWEST ended
 * rows; anything older is EVICTED from the registry. Chosen to be comfortably
 * above `SNAPSHOT_ENDED_GLOBAL` (120) so the visible window can always be
 * served from resident rows: at 120 the newest-120 window is exactly the
 * retained tier, and the per-group first-3 window is a subset of it. A cap of
 * 120 would make eviction and window selection race at exactly the boundary.
 * 2x gives headroom for the per-group selection to draw from.
 *
 * Eviction is NOT archival. The row is already persisted (the `onUnregister`
 * seam writes the sidecar) and `restore()` reloads it from disk on the next
 * boot, so what is lost is the in-memory row, not the session's history. The
 * `listAll()` surface — which the archive UI and `/api/sessions` page over —
 * therefore stops returning rows older than the tier, exactly as the snapshot
 * window already stopped showing them.
