 * whether or not auth is configured — with OAuth off the rejecting auth hook is
 * not registered at all, which is precisely the gap this closes.
 *
 * Decision order, all on the parsed PATHNAME:
 *   1. unparseable target → deny (fail closed)
 *   2. outside jurisdiction → return (served as today)
 *   3. in-namespace public exception (`/api/health`, pairing, `bypassUrls`) → return
 *   4. pass condition (genuine-local, local-token, trusted CIDR, isAuthenticated) → return
 *   5. otherwise → log + deny with the shared `network_not_allowed` shape
 *
 * The PASS CONDITIONS are the per-route guard's, unchanged. The EXCEPTIONS are
 * not: a route that matches a configured `bypassUrls` prefix AND carries a
 * per-route `networkGuard` is admitted here and then refused by that
 * `preHandler`. That is exactly today's behavior (`bypassUrls` has only ever
 * skipped the auth plugin), so no regression — recorded so the trade-off is
 * stated rather than implied.
 * See change: add-universal-network-guard.
